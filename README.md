### connect.sh
Easy (as one-two-three... literally) and fast ssh connection, just add your hosts and set vpn connection reminder.
I recommend putting this in ```/usr/local/bin``` without an extension or using it as an alias.

### sdbsync.sh
Synchronization of the main and standby database with secrets located on SD cards.
