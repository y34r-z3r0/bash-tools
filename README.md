### connect.sh
Easy (as one-two-three... literally) and fast ssh connection, just add your hosts and set vpn connection reminder (if it's needed).
I recommend putting this in ```/usr/local/bin``` without an extension or using it as an alias.

### sdbsync.sh
Synchronization of the main and standby database with secrets located on SD cards.

### hider.sh
Drop this file in the directory where you want to hide everything and execute.
The file will self-destruct.
