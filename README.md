### connect.sh
Easy (as one-two-three... literally) and fast ssh connection, just add your hosts and set vpn connection reminder (if it's needed).
I recommend put this in ```/usr/local/bin``` without an extension or use it as an alias.

### hider.sh
Especially for those who have something to hide.
Put this script in the directory where you want to hide all the files and run it. Once executed, the script file will self-destruct.
